Setup:

installed all packages manually
need a express-server to serve our static front-end files (created by webpack)
note: using create-react-app or react-scripts, we would've gotten a dev server

1. create-react-app: installs everything we need (plus things we don't need)
2. react-scripts: installs our dev server, but not react, react-dom, etc.
